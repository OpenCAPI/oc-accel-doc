# oc-accel-doc
Raw documentation repository for oc-accel
The documentation uses mkdocs as a Content Management System to publish the content.
This repository barely stores the raw content of the oc-accel documentation.

The output website which is showing the actual doc with mkdocs is:
 <https://opencapi.github.io/oc-accel-doc/>

Watch out that this repository is not automatically linked to the publication.
Every change in the raw doc should be :
* raw published in this repo
* nicely published using "mkdocs gh-deploy" as explained in oc-accel documentation user's guide :
  <https://opencapi.github.io/oc-accel-doc/misc/doc-guide/>
